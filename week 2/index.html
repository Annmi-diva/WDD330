          <li>Some thinks I want to remember about this chapter:</li>

            <ul>
              <li>The following words are reserved for use by the JavaScript language and cannot be used to name variables 
                  (or function parameters and object properties that appear in later chapters): abstract, await, 
                  boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger,
                  default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, 
                  function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, 
                  package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient,
                  true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield, undefined, NaN, Infinity.</li>

              <li>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are listed below: String, 
                  Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.), Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null. 
                  Any value that isn't one of the primitive data types listed above is an object. 
                  These include arrays, functions and object literals.</li>

              <li>From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords “const” and “let” to declare variables. 
                  The keyword “const” is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, 
                  whereas “let” is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</li>

              <li>If the variable references a non-primitive data type, such as an array, function or object, then using “const” will not make it immutable. 
                  This means the underlying data inside the object can change (known as mutating the object). </li>

              <li>Template literals use the backtick character, `, to delaminate the string. hey also allow interpolation of JavaScript code. 
                  This means that a JavaScript expression can be inserted inside a string and the result will be displayed. 
                  The JavaScript expression is placed inside the curly braces with a $ character in front of them. 
                  This is then evaluated, and the result is returned in the string output. 
                  Template literals can also contain line breaks, which are all converted into a Line Feed (\n).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>  

      <li><h3>Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3></li>

        <ul>

          <li><a href="quizNinja2.html">Quiz Ninja Project 2</a></li>

          <li>Some thinks I want to remember about this chapter:</li>

          <ul>
            <li>To place a string inside the first element of an array, we can assign it to element 0. 
                Each item in an array can be treated like a variable. 
                You can change the value using the assignment operator =. 
                We can add more values to our array by assigning them to other indices, meaning instead of 0, we use 1,2,3, etc. 
                We can use the index notation to add new items to any position in the array.</li>
              
            <li>The delete operator will remove an item from an array, 
                we need to be carful thought when you delete an entry it deletes the variable name but not the position, 
                in that position you will find the legend undefined.</li>

            <li>Destructuring Arrays allows us to assign multiple values at the same time, using arrays.</li>

            <li>A set is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate values. 
                They are similar in concept to a mathematical set, although (for the time being at least) 
                they don't contain mathematical set operations such as union, intersection and product. 
                Sets offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have been duplicated. 
                It's also quick and easy to check if a particular value is in a set, which can be a slow operation if an array is used.</li>

            <li>A set can be converted into an array by placing the set, along with the spread operator directly inside an array literal.</li>
              
            <li>Maps are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, 
                and are like 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages. 
                At first glance, maps appear to be like JavaScript objects, but they have some noticeable differences:</li>

              <ul>

                <li>Objects are limited to using strings for key values, whereas maps can use any data type as a key.</li>

                <li>There is no efficient way to find the number of key-value pairs an object has, whereas this is easy to do with maps using the size property.</li>

                <li>Objects have methods that can be called and prototypes that can be used to create a chain of inheritance,
                     whereas maps are solely focused on the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.</li>

                <li>The value of an object's properties can be accessed directly, whereas maps restrict you to using the get() method to retrieve any values.</li>

              </ul>


          </ul>

      <li><h3>Ch4: Functions</h3></li>
        
        <ul>

          <li><a href="quizNinja3.html">Quiz Ninja Project 3</a></li>

          <li>Some thinks I want to remember about this chapter:</li>

            <ul>

              <li>A function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like a small, self-contained mini program. 
                Functions can help reduce repetition and make code easier to follow.</li>
              
              <li>To define a function literal, we can use a function declaration, or create a function expression, this assigns an anonymous function to a variable. 
                A function can also be declared using the constructor Function(). The body of the function is entered as a string. 
                It's not recommended to declare functions in this way as there are numerous problems associated with placing the function body inside a string.</li>

              <li>Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input. 
                There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. 
                When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.</li>

              <li>ES6 introduced a new syntax for declaring functions called the arrow syntax. 
                These make declaring functions much more succinct by using less verbose syntax. 
                Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that gives them their name. 
                The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. 
                Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable.</li>

              <li>Functions can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback. 
                We can make a function more flexible by adding a callback parameter, 
                this means that in the parenthesis if the function we add “callback”, 
                and we also need to call the callback function on the “body” of the function as callback(), 
                then when using our function we can add as a parameter another function 
                that will be used where the callback function was added in the “body” of our function.</li>

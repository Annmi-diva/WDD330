    <h1>WDD 330 portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Week 01</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li>

          <h3>Doing Stuff with Web Things: Remembering User's Info</h3>
            <ul>
              <li href="https://annmi-diva.github.io/WDD330/week 1/CodeSample-story_editor.html">Story Editor Exercise</li>
              <li>I love the part that says that computers are stupid! Meaning they are literal,
                so we need to be carful, simple and organized when writing code so they do as we want.
              </li>
              <li>The term "var" is like separating things in boxes with labels.</li>
              <li>the "value" term is for dealing with input or textarea tags, for dealing with sections you use the term "innerHTML".</li>
              <li>My Description of Key-Value pairs: to me is like a file and the content in the file, the name of the file is the key, the content of the file is the value.</li>
              <li>I was not sure how to review the book in general so I focused my notes in the section asked on the reading part of this weeks work, so this is pretty much it.</li>

            </ul>
          <h3>Master mobile UX</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Develop content from the smallest device up.</li>
              <li>Don't look for what people tell you they want, observe their way of life, 
                habits and what they do in a daily basis and
                look for what is challenging for them to see the opportunities to make think easier or better, 
                so you are able to truly see what they need.</li>
              <li>3 important thinks every program or web page need to be:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>Immediate - quick responses so users feel that they have the help they need.</li>
                  <li>Relevant - Satisfy user needs and provide what they want in an easy and fast way.</li>
                  <li>Frictionless - We are talking about not only fast loading but functionality. Few steps to get to the desire information for users.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>While building apps or web pages we need to look at people's way of navigation, 
                so we are able to design the navigation in a way that is easy and intuitive for people, 
                so they can feel is fast and easy.</li>
              <li>Mobile = simplification </li>
            </ul>


        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>More than a question per say, I'm struggling with the pages concept og github, I tried doing what it said in the build a portfolio link, but I got confused,
            it would be great to have a better example of the step by step.</li>
          <li>Also, in the build a portfolio link, it talks about an index file to keep track of all the work we do,
             how is that different from the table of content? And how is it supposed to be structured?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
